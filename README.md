## redict

Redict allows you to create dictionary-like objects that instead of mapping
keys to values map regular epxressions to values. This allows you to map
all strings that match a certain pattern to one value:

      from redict import Redict
      rd = Redict('.*foo.*': 1, '.*bar.*': 2)

      rd['sklfjd_foo_adsflkj']
      # => 1
      rd['000000_foo_0000000']
      # => 1
      rd['1_bar_bazzzzz']
      # => 2

There's not much more to it, but here are the autogenerated docs: [Read the
